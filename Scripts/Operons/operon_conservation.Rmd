```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Last time we reformatted our data, performed some preliminary analysis, and obtained the sequences of each significant operon in each isolate. What we need to do now is get a master spreadsheet of each operon with the following format:

Operon number |  27509   |  27553   | 28262
------------- |  -----   |  -----   | -----
      1       |    5     |    4     |  4
      2       |    2     |    2     |  2
      3       |    2     |    2     |  2
      4       |    4     |    4     |  3


```{r}

```
